## Welcome\!

Text mining, or natural language processing (NLP) is the organization,
classification, labeling and extraction of information from structured
and unstructured text data. In these days of more information readily
available through the internet, analysts and decision makers find
themselves overloaded with data. Text mining is an application which can
help analysts glean necessary information either for general
understanding about a corpus of text documents, or for putting text into
a form useful for the application of alternative analysis techniques.

This course will introduce students to this rapidly growing field and
equip them with some of its basic principles and tools as well as its
general mindset. Students will learn concepts, techniques and tools they
need to deal with text mining practice in a Joint military context.

## Course Learning Objectives

The primary objective of this course is to help students understand and
implement the techniques/processes of text mining to make better
decisions. More specifically, at the completion of the course, students
should be able to:

  - Understanding when, where, and how to perform text mining to
    appropriate problems and data sets.
  - Code and understand code using relevant R packages in text mining.
  - Lead and work within a group of researchers analyzing a specific
    text mining problem.
  - Use software to analyze text data and communicate the results of
    their analyses.

## Pre-requisites & Co-requisites

Unless otherwise waived by the course instructor, students are required
to have completed the following courses prior to enrolling in LOGM 655 -
Text Mining.

  - None

Requests to waive these required courses must be made in accordance with
AFIT EN policy guidelines and must be approved by the course instructor.
Waivers my be approved for students that have has successfully completed
a similar courses or if special arrangements are made to meet AFIT
requirements.

## Grading Policy & Course Deliverables

Your final course grade will be determined according to the following
requirements and their respective weights.

  - 15% [Lesson Planning/Topic Summarization](logm655_lesson_plan)
  - 25% [Group Activities](logm655_group_activities)

In this course, grades will be assigned according to the values shown in
the table below. The following sections detail the requirements of each
graded deliverable.

| Numerical grade range | Corresponding letter grade |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------- |

### Github

Information about course requirements distributed and collected using
GitHub. Thus, each student will first need to create an account on
[**GitHub**](https://github.com/), if they don’t already have one.

> Tip: Don’t use your `awesome.student@afit.edu` email address to create
> your account. Use an email address that you’ll have access to after
> you graduate. If desired, you can add your AFIT address as a secondary
> email.

After you’ve created your account on GitHub, click
[**HERE**](https://github.com/afit-r/logm655/issues/1) to access the
course “Roll Call”. Read and follow the instructions to post your
comment so I know that you’ve successfully created an account.

## Software/Computer Programming

A key component of this course involves developing the skills and
knowledge to create **reproducible & dynamic** data products to present
results from your research. In previous offerings of this course, I
allowed students to use any software package to complete their
assignments. This became difficult, for the students to complete their
work and for me to grade them. So, I’ve decided to require you to use
the R programming language to complete and submit your assignments.

I realize that some of you may be new to coding or may have never coded
before. Don’t worry, you don’t need an extensive background in R, , or
HTML to be successful in this course. Each week I’ll provide you with
LOTS of code examples that you can copy/paste to help you get more
familiar with the software. Also, many created several demo
presentations to get you up to speed and I’m always willing to help out
when needed. The first link provided for Week 1 in the schedule below
walks you through the process of getting the R/RStudio tool-chain
installed and ready for the course.

Each of these tools listed below will be used this quarter:

  - R Project for Statistical Computing
  - RStudio IDE
  - Git/Github
  - LaTeX/Mathjax
  - Pandoc Markdown
  - HTML<sub>5</sub>, CSS3, and JavaScript (don’t need to know these -
    already built in\!)

## Important Policy Statements

### Academic Integrity Policy Statement

All students must adhere to the highest standards of academic integrity.
Students are prohibited from engaging in plagiarism, cheating,
misrepresentation, or any other act constituting a lack of academic
integrity. Failure on the part of any individual to practice academic
integrity is not condoned and will not be tolerated. Individuals who
violate this policy are subject to adverse administrative action
including disenrollment from school and disciplinary action. Individuals
subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice may be prosecuted under
the UCMJ. Violations by government civilian employees may result in
administrative disciplinary action without regard to otherwise
applicable criminal or civil sanctions for violations of related laws.
(References: ***Student Handbook, ENOI 36-107, Academic Integrity***)

### Attendance Policy Statement

Attendance at all class sessions and exams is mandatory for military and
civilians assigned to AFIT as full-time students except for extenuating
circumstances. Part-time students are expected to attend scheduled
classes, and absences should be explained to the instructor. The student
should provide advance notice, if possible. Scheduled classes and exams
are defined by the instructor and they are documented in the course
schedule. (References: ***Student Handbook, Graduate School Catalog***)

### Academic Grievance Policy Statement

AFIT and the Graduate School of Engineering and Management affirm the
right of each student to resolve grievances with the Institution.
Students are guaranteed the right of fair hearing and appeal in all
matters of judgment of academic performance. Procedures are detailed in
***ENOI 36-138, Student Academic Performance Appeals***.

## Additional Notes

### My Teaching Philosophy

As **AFIT graduates**, you should be expected to know how to approach
and solve real-world problems AND present your results in a meaningful
way so that decision makers can make defensible decisions.

As **AFIT instructors**, we do a disservice to our students by not
teaching new and improved ways to produce and share your results.
Further, we do a disservice by teaching you to solve problems using
tools that you won’t have access to after leaving AFIT. Therefore, I
re-built this course using the R/RStudio tool-chain to help you produce
better results…faster.

### Challenge your instructor

Challenging your instructor can often be a good thing. If you can’t trip
me up in this class from time to time, you’re not trying. Discussion
leads to a more interesting class, so questions are always good.
