Many data science projects cannot be completed by one person.  This is especially if the project must be completed by a deadline. Thus, it's important that every analyst be comfortable working with other analysts in a team. In this course students will be separated into no more than four teams and will exercise their teamwork skills by completing two in-class activities as described below.

Student teams will center around four key topic areas in text mining/NLP.  The topic areas are:

- Topic modeling
- Parts of speech tagging
- Document summarization
- Named entity recognition

My goal is to balance the number of members within each of the teams - the size of the teams will depend on the number of students registered for the course.  This means that some students may not be assigned to their prefereed topic.  However, preference will be given to students who can show that they are working on thesis projects related to one of these topics.

## Activity $\# 1$ In-Class Presentation (15 pts):

Du the class will be presented with a text mining application problem.  The class period will be devoted to coming up with the best solution for each of those problems.  The event will be graded as far as completion of the assignment, but additionally, each student will fill out a survey on the participation of all the students in the class.  That survey will be used to distribute the grade appropriately as demonstrated by your effort towards assisting the group accomplish the assignment.  
	
## Workshop (10 pts):

The class after a student delivers a class on the assigned topic, the student will lead a workshop involving the other members of the class on advancing their course project work.  The student leading the workshop will give some discussion on the topic and background of the project, and will then introduce 1-3 problems they are struggling with for their project.  These problems can be anything from specific areas of their existing code not working (troubleshooting), to documentation, to developing new code to increase functionality of existing code.  Bottom line, the problems introduced must be in class time allotted sized sections that would be reasonable to get accomplished within the class time only (no homework assignments allowed).  This is an opportunity to advance each of your course projects by gaining the input of the class â€“ take advantage of this opportunity.  Plan for at least 70-80 minutes of workshop within the class.  Grade will be assessed based on the ability to motivate the group around the proposed project topic, making full use of the allotted time and the presence with which the group leader leads the workshop.  Though not graded, some examples of tools which can be used to help organize the group are slides on the topic and background, assigning of teams to work particular problems, etc (get creative).

in applying text analysis. during this course. When conducting analysis using coding, that process is perhaps more evident.  In order to develop code when working together, the team must work with each other and each must individually develop their method for working successfully within a group.  These exercises will   __This is worth 25% of your overall grade.__ as well as each student will lead a workshop on their project topic.
